# aws-data-architecture

In this transformative project, weâ€™ll be building a comprehensive and secure architecture for analytics and machine learning pipelines using AWS. This project uses the ELT approach for building data pipelines, and Kmeans for clustering, while emphasizing security measures for data integrity and privacy. Additionally, we leveraged AWS Lambda functions to efficiently retrieve data from S3 and expose it through an API using Amazon API Gateway. Here are some of the key achievements and activities undertaken in this project:

- Implemented Data Lake, and access controls through user groups and role-based access permissions in AWS Lake Formation.
- Leveraged AWS Glue, S3, AWS Glue workflows for ELT and Orchestration.
- Utilized Amazon Athena for ad-hoc querying and analysis of data.
- Applied machine learning techniques, such as clustering with K-means, to extract valuable insights using AWS Glue
- Utilized AWS Lambda functions to efficiently retrieve data from S3 and expose it through an API using Amazon API Gateway.
